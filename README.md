# Simple-RSA-Implementation

This is a simple C++ library that I am making as part of my L2K log. It uses C++ to encode and decode data by the RSA algorithm. It is simple; it can only encode and decode data and some numbers have to be found - they are not automatically generated.

## Build Instructions

You must have g++ or another similar compiler to run this.
1. In your chosen directory, type `git clone https://github.com/computeraided/aimple-rsa-implementation` or download and unzip the repository contents.
2. Type `make` in the command line.
3. Run the program with `./Simple-RSA-Implementation`

## Licensing

## Current Status

The code is not fully complete. However, the code should be compilable.
